Easy MailChimp Forms allows you to painlessly add MailChimp signup forms to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Easy MailChimp Forms allows you to painlessly add MailChimp signup forms to your WordPress site. You can add forms to posts, pages or sidebars with shortcodes, widgets or template tags. Simply copy and paste your MailChimp API Key into the plugin admin settings and it will pull in all your MailChimp lists. From there you can choose the lists you want to make forms for. For a single list you can check off the fields you want to include on your form and order them via an easy drag-and-drop interface. This plugin adds plenty of CSS selectors to the form code allowing you to completely customize the look of your forms.

**Note:** You will need a MailChimp API key to allow this plugin to communicate with your MailChimp account. For help on retrieving your API key, check out [question #4 of the FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender/faq/). You can also read the MailChimp knowledge base article [Where can I find my API key and how can I use the API](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have a MailChimp Account? =
Yes, you can register for one for free at [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/signup/ "MailChimp Signup").

= Do I need to have lists already set up in MailChimp? =
Yes, you have to have at least 1 list set up in MailChimp. 

For more help, visit the MailChimp Support article [How do I create a new list?](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key "How do I create a new list?")

= What do I do first? =
The first step is to add your MailChimp API key. This will allow your site to communicate with your MailChimp account. This is done on the plugin "MailChimp Settings" page.

= Where do I find my API Key? =
From your MailChimp Dashboard, click on your account name in the upper left hand corner of the screen under the MailChimp logo to expose the "Account Settings" menu. Click on "Account Settings" to go to the Account Settings screen and the click on the "Extras" menu. Under "Extras" choose "API keys." From there you can create a new key if you do not already have one.

For more help, visit the MailChimp Support article [Where can I find my API Key?](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key "Where can I find my API Key?")

= How to I add my MailChimp lists? =
After you add your API key, the plugin will fetch all of your MailChimp list information and load it into the plugin admin. Go to the plugin "Manage List Forms" page to choose the lists you want to make forms for.

= How do I add the MailChimp signup forms to my site? =
You can use a shortcode to add a form to a page or post, use the MailChimp form button in the visual editor or use a widget to add it to a sidebar. Each list on the plugin "Manage List Forms" displays a shortcode at the top. Copy the shortcode and paste it into any post or page where you want a form to appear. For example, if my form had the shortcode [yks-mailchimp-list id="1234567891"] I would copy and paste that into the page or post I wanted to add that form to.

= I input a valid MailChimp API key, but it returns invalid every time. I've already tried a new API key, but no dice. What's up? =

**Step 1:** Ensure that cURL is enabled at the server level. You will see an error at the top of the settings page if cURL is disabled. If you see no error, continue to step 2.

**Step 2:** If you have entered your MailChimp API key and are still getting the error "*Error: Please enter a valid Mail Chimp API Key*," please check the developer console inside your browser for further information. 

- Right-click in the API Key input field, and select 'Inpsect Element'
- Once the developer console is open, select the Console tab to see a more specific error.

For information on how to use your browser's developer console, read the WordPress Codex article, [Using Your Browser to Diagnose JavaScript Errors](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Your_Browser_to_Diagnose_JavaScript_Errors).

**Possible Errors And Resolutions**

* Could not resolve host: xxxx.api.mailchimp.com  - the host you have provided is incorrect. The host is the string after the last dash (example: us2)
* Invalid Mailchimp API Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxx - Your API key is invalid. You can confirm a valid key by logging into [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) and checking the active API key registered to your account.

= I don't want the form to be the 100% width. How can I adjust the width myself? =
You can adjust the width of the forms on your site by changing the width of the element with the class .yks-mailchimpFormContainer. This is the parent container for the form. Adjusting this width will control the width of the input fields inside of it.

= How can I translate this plugin? =
Easy MailChimp Forms is now translated into multiple languages:

* Arabic
* Chinese
* English
* French
* German
* Greek
* Hebrew
* Hindi
* Hong Kong

**Helper Functions**

** Description**
These functions are defined inside of the Easy MailChimp plugin and they exist to help test and view the user data that is being submitted by the user through the MailChimp form. These functions will prevent the default form functionality, so no user data will be sent to MailChimp while testing.

These functions should be used in conjunction with the `yikes_mc_get_form_data` or the `yikes_mc_get_form_data_$formID` filters. Whatever data the user has provided will be returned for viewing.

**Provided Functions**
`yks_mc_print_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );` and `yks_mc_dump_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );`


**How to Use**
*Print User Data*
`
<?php
	/**
	* This example will return all of the submitted 
	* user data In a nice readable format
	*/
	function print_user_data_from_form( $form_ID, $merge_variables ) {
		if( class_exists( 'yksemeBase' ) ) {
			$yikes_easy_mailchimp = new yksemeBase();
		}
		$yikes_easy_mailchimp->yks_mc_print_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );
	}
	add_filter( 'yikes_mc_get_form_data' , 'print_user_data_from_form', 10, 2 );
?>
`
*Dump User Data*
`
<?php
	/**
	* This example will dump all of the submitted 
	* user data, so you can see the full array of data
	* being returned
	*/
	function dump_user_data_from_form( $form_ID, $merge_variables ) {
		if( class_exists( 'yksemeBase' ) ) {
			$yikes_easy_mailchimp = new yksemeBase();
		}
		$yikes_easy_mailchimp->yks_mc_dump_user_data( $form_ID, $merge_variables );
	}
	add_filter( 'yikes_mc_get_form_data' , 'dump_user_data_from_form', 10, 2 );
